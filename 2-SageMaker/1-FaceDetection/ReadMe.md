# Build, train and deploy Face Detection model using Amazon SageMaker

In this module, you will learn how to build and train a face detection model using Amazon SageMaker.

## Create SageMaker Notebook Instance

1. Go to SageMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/landing
  ___Make sure you have us-east-1 selected as region.___

2. Click on Create Notebook instance

3. Under Notebook instance settings:
- Notebook instance name: Enter a name eg: DeepLearning
- Notebook instance type: ml.t2.medium
- IAM role: Click on 'Create a new role'
  - Under Create an IAM role: Select "Any S3 bucket" and click "Create role".

## Upload and Open Notebook

You can upload individual notebooks using Jypyter UI, but in this lab we will use git to bring notebook in our SageMaker instance.

- Click on New and choose Terminal from the drop down list.

- Type: "cd SageMaker" command to go to SageMaker directory.
- Type: "git clone https://github.com/darwaishx/Deep-Learning-With-Deep-Lens.git" command to clone github repo.
- Type: "ls" command and you should now see a folder "Deep-Learning-With-Deep-Lens"

## Execute Notebook

- You can execute notebook cells by either clicking on run button in the menu or using shift+ enter on your keyboard.
