#Afternoon Session – Additional project ideas

- Create your own extension using any AWS service (or others). For example:
- Analytic dashboard using Elastic Search
- Track you pet and trigger warning if it jumps on the sofa (using Polly)
- Using celebrity recognition in the face flow (using magazines or web search for images)
- Implement people counting system
- Implement VIP gate or automatic garage door
